# Background

This project is from the follow-up research on https://github.com/chsoo92/cctv-eyetracking-analysis/blob/master/VSS16Poster_Joseph.pdf

Previous experiments obtained CCTV eye-tracking data of 4 action categories (confront, play, nothing, and fight) from novices and experts. There were 9 videos for each circumstance. According to Itti's saliency model for the fixation area in the videos, novices and experts showed a marginally significant difference on the saliency of their looking area near the end of videos (last 2 seconds among the entire 16 s), averaging across 4 video categories. The effect was marginally significant for both 38 pixel diameter (p = 0.092) and 75 pixel diameter (p = 0.076). Experts got higher saliency indices than novices. By looking at the four action categories separately, there was no significant difference between experts and novices.
